<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial goal was to create a standalone vendor application from a reference project. The project evolved significantly into building a professional, high-quality, full-stack vendor panel inspired by platforms like Trendyol and Shopify.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
1.  **Tech Stack:** React (CRA) + TypeScript frontend, connected to a separate, pre-existing FastAPI backend.
2.  **UI/UX Overhaul:** A complete, professional redesign of the entire vendor panel with a specific color palette ( background,  text) and modern UI components. The logo must be integrated seamlessly.
3.  **Authentication & Routing:** JWT-based login connected to the external backend, with role-based () access control and protected routes.
4.  **Core Features:**
    *   **Dashboard:** Comprehensive overview of sales and orders.
    *   **Product Management:** Full CRUD for products.
    *   **Order Management:** List, view, and manage orders.
    *   **Profile Management:** Manage store and payment (IBAN) information.
5.  **New Feature Requests (Massive Expansion):**
    *   **Product Image Uploads:** Ability to add multiple photos when creating/editing a product.
    *   **IBAN Management:** A dedicated section in the profile for vendors to add their bank account details for payouts.
    *   **Get Directions for Orders:** A button on the order details page to open the customer's address in a map application.
    *   **Campaigns & Discounts:** A system for vendors to create and manage product campaigns and discounts, inspired by Trendyol.
    *   **Full Professional Suite:** The user requested a massive expansion to include:
        *   Financial Management (Payments, Invoices)
        *   Analytics & Reporting
        *   Customer Communication (Reviews, Messages)
        *   Help & Support Center
        *   Advanced Product Features (Variants, Bundles)
        *   Multi-Channel Sales (Instagram, Facebook, Google Shopping integration)

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
A functional React frontend application that is successfully connected to an external FastAPI backend. The UI has been significantly redesigned according to the user's specifications, including a new color scheme and a professional logo implementation. A persistent login/redirection issue has been resolved.

The application includes the core pages (Login, Register, Dashboard, Products, Orders, Profile). In response to user requests, the agent has also created numerous placeholder pages and components for a massive feature expansion, including Analytics, Payments, Campaigns, Reviews, and more. The basic structure and routing for this expansion are in place, but the pages are currently empty shells.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent was executing a massive feature expansion plan approved by the user. It had just created placeholder pages for Advanced Product Features () and Multi-Channel Sales () and added the corresponding links to the sidebar and application routes.
-   Status: **IN PROGRESS**
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? **screenshot tool** (to verify new pages are accessible from the sidebar).
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: (P1) The backend integration for the **Product Photo Upload** feature is missing. The frontend UI for uploading files was added to the Add/Edit Product modal, but the logic to send the file(s) to the backend and store the image URLs has not been implemented.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The feature was requested, UI was built, but implementation was paused due to other user requests.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Confirm the external backend has an endpoint for file uploads (e.g., ).
        2.  Update the  service to include a function for uploading files (likely using ).
        3.  Modify the  function in  to first upload images, get their URLs, and then include those URLs in the product creation/update payload.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical e-commerce feature. Completing it will allow vendors to manage product visuals.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
    -   Blocked on other issue: None.

-   Issue 2: (P1) The backend integration for **saving IBAN information** is missing. The UI fields were added to the  page, but the functionality to persist this data via an API call is not implemented.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The feature was requested, UI was built, but implementation was paused.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Confirm the external backend's  endpoint accepts , , and  fields.
        2.  Update the save handler in  to send these new fields in the API call payload.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is essential for vendor payouts, a core part of the business logic.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both
    -   Blocked on other issue: None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: (P0) Implement the complete suite of professional vendor panel features. The agent has created placeholder pages and must now build out the functionality for each.
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has created all the necessary files and routes. The next step is to pick the first feature from the list (e.g., Financial Management) and start building its UI and backend integration.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will transform the application from a basic CRUD app into a feature-rich, professional-grade platform that meets the user's Trendyol-level expectations.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both (incrementally for each feature)
    -   **Blocked on something:** The capabilities of the external backend are unknown. The agent will need to assume or ask about API endpoints for each new feature.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks (P0 - Part of the main In Progress Task):**
    1.  **Financial Management:** Build out . Implement UI for viewing revenue, managing withdrawal requests, and seeing payment history.
    2.  **Analytics & Raporlama:** Build out . Integrate  to display sales graphs and performance metrics.

    -   Created placeholder pages, routes, and sidebar links for a massive expansion, including Payments, Analytics, Reviews, Campaigns, Help, and more.
    -   Installed  and  in preparation for the Analytics page.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. The agent has been diligent, but the user's rapid-fire requests have caused some partially implemented features (like image uploads and IBAN saving) to be left pending backend integration. These are captured in the Pending Issues list.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Create React App (CRA), Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router, React Context API.
-   **Backend:** Interfacing with an external FastAPI REST API.
-   **Authentication:** JWT stored in localStorage, managed via Context API, and sent in an  header.
-   **Routing:** Protected routes for authenticated users.

**key DB schema**
The agent is working against an external backend, so it has no direct access to the DB. It infers the schema from API responses:
-   **user:** , ,  (, ), .
-   **product:** , , , , , , .
-   **order:** , , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
-   The application was pivoted from using an integrated FastAPI backend () to a purely frontend application that consumes an external, pre-existing API. The local backend code is now obsolete.

**All files of reference**
-   : Critical file defining the Axios instance and all API communication.
-   : Manages user state, login/logout, and token persistence.
-   : Protects routes from unauthenticated access.
-   : Defines all application routes.
-   : Contains navigation links that need to be kept in sync with new features.
-   : Contains the  for the external backend.
-   All new page files in .

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is likely obsolete as it was designed for the local MongoDB and backend. It should be reviewed and potentially deleted.
-   The  directory is unused and could be removed to avoid confusion.

**key api endpoints**
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   
-   *(The agent will need to discover or be told the endpoints for all new features like campaigns, analytics, etc.)*

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Massive Scope:** The user has requested an enormous number of features. The highest priority is to work through the list of new pages, implementing them one by one. Do not get sidetracked.
-   **External Backend:** You are building a frontend against an existing API. You do not control the backend. For every new feature (Analytics, Payments, etc.), you must clarify the required API endpoints and data structures. Do not assume they exist.
-   **Incremental Development:** Tackle one feature at a time. For example, fully implement the  page (UI, API connection, testing) before moving to .
-   **Revisit Pending Features:** Before starting the brand new features, it would be wise to complete the backend integration for the already-started **Product Image Upload** and **IBAN Profile** features. These are smaller, critical wins.

**documents created in this job**
-   , : Temporary test files that can now be deleted.
-   Many new page component files under .

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not forget but had to postpone the full implementation of two features due to the user's shifting priorities:
    1.  **Product Photo Upload:** The backend API call to handle the file upload was never implemented.
    2.  **IBAN Profile Update:** The backend API call to save the IBAN details was never implemented.</analysis>
