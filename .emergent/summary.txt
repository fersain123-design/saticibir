<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a standalone vendor application based on a reference GitHub repository. The original project contained both customer and vendor applications, which caused preview issues.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
The goal is to build a completely new, standalone application *only for vendors* using the following tech stack:
- **Frontend:** React Web with TypeScript (initially requested Expo React Native, but later confirmed React Web).
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript (later changed to Python + FastAPI due to technical difficulties).
- **Database:** MongoDB.

The user provided a highly detailed specification for the application, including:
1.  **Full UI/UX Overhaul:** A professional, high-quality redesign of the entire vendor panel, inspired by platforms like Trendyol, Hepsiburada, and Shopify. This includes a specific new color palette based on the user's logo, a new background color (), and modern UI components (shadows, gradients, rounded cards).
2.  **Authentication:** JWT-based auth (access + refresh tokens) with a mandatory Tax ID document upload during registration. Vendor accounts must go through an approval flow (, , , ), with feature access restricted based on status.
3.  **Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard with widgets for key metrics (revenue, orders), charts for sales trends, lists of recent orders, and low-stock products.
4.  **Product Management:** Full CRUD functionality for products, including multi-image uploads, stock management, status toggling (Published/Unpublished), and product quality selection.
5.  **Order Management:** A system to list, filter, and view details of orders. It must allow vendors to update order statuses (e.g., Preparing, On the Way, Delivered).
6.  **Public Store Page:** A view for the vendor to see their public-facing store page as a customer would.
7.  **Profile Management:** A detailed profile page for vendors to manage store information, contact details, working hours, and payment information (IBAN).

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
A complete full-stack application has been built.
-   **Backend:** A robust FastAPI (Python) application is running. It includes all required endpoints for authentication, vendor management, product CRUD, order management, and dashboard statistics. It connects to a MongoDB database.
-   **Frontend:** A complete React + TypeScript application has been built with all the necessary pages (Login, Register, Dashboard, Products, Orders, Profile) and components (Sidebar, Topbar). It is fully connected to the backend API.
-   **Data:** A demo vendor account has been created and the database has been seeded with sample products and orders.
-   **Styling:** A previous rebranding was completed, applying a logo and a color palette. However, this is now superseded by a new, more demanding design request.

**Last working item**:
-   Last item agent was working: The agent acknowledged the user's latest and most significant request: a complete professional UI/UX overhaul of the entire frontend to match the quality of platforms like Trendyol and Shopify. The agent's first step was to update the Tailwind CSS configuration with the new, logo-compliant color palette. The user then provided a final tweak, requesting the background color be changed to .
-   Status: **IN PROGRESS**
-   Agent Testing Done: N
-   Which testing method agent to use? **screenshot tool** (to verify the visual changes of the UI overhaul).
-   User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: (P0) A demo account was created, but the user reported a frontend crash () upon logging in and viewing the Dashboard. This was the last reported bug before the major redesign request.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent identified that the  object from the backend was sometimes undefined. A fix was implemented in  to add optional chaining () to prevent the crash. The backend endpoint was also updated to return a more complete data structure. The fix was successful and confirmed by the agent.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** While the specific crash was fixed, the new redesign will involve rewriting this component. The next agent must ensure that all data fetched from the dashboard endpoint is handled safely with optional chaining or default values to prevent similar errors.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fixing this ensures the Dashboard, the first page after login, is functional and doesn't crash, providing a stable user experience.
    -   **Status:** RESOLVED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Frontend

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: (P0) Complete UI/UX Overhaul for a Professional Vendor Panel
    -   **Where to resume:** The agent has just updated the Tailwind config () with the new primary colors and acknowledged the user's request to set the background to . The next step is to apply this background color globally (likely in  or the main layout component) and then proceed with redesigning each component and page according to the user's detailed specifications.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The application will be transformed from a functional MVP into a visually polished, professional, and commercially viable product that matches the user's high-quality design expectations.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (using screenshot tool)
    -   **Blocked on something:** No

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **UI/UX Redesign Sub-tasks (P0):**
    1.  **Global Styles:** Apply the new background color  and ensure the text colors (, ) are used consistently.
    2.  **Dashboard Redesign:** Rework  to match the Trendyol/Shopify quality standard, using modern, shadowed card layouts.
    3.  **Product Management Redesign:**
        -   Update the product list in  to use status badges (green for published, gray for unpublished) and action menus.
        -   Modify the Add/Edit Product form/modal to include fields for multi-photo upload, product quality selection (), and a View on Store button.
    4.  **Public Store Page:** Create a new route and component for the Mağazamı Görüntüle (View My Store) page, which shows a public view of the vendor's profile and products.
    5.  **Profile Page Redesign:** Overhaul  to include fields for IBAN, notification settings, and an improved layout for managing store details.
    6.  **Animations & Polish:** Add smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.

**changes in tech stack**
The project was initially planned with a Node.js/Express/TypeScript backend. Due to significant and time-consuming TypeScript compilation and dependency issues, a strategic decision was made, with user approval, to switch to a Python/FastAPI backend. The abandoned Node.js code still exists in  but is not used.

**All files of reference**
-   : The entire backend logic is contained in this single file.
-   : Contains  and .
-   : Updated with the new color palette for the redesign.
-   : The entire React application source code, which will be heavily modified during the redesign.
-   : Contains all the main page components to be redesigned.
-   : Contains the main layout components to be redesigned.
-   : Used to create the demo user and data.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The entire  directory is the subject of the current task, which is a complete design and code refactoring to meet the user's new professional UI/UX standards.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The backend is complete, stable, and built with FastAPI. Do not try to revert to Node.js.
- The current and highest priority task is a **complete visual and structural overhaul of the frontend**. This is not a bug-fixing task but a major redesign based on the user's last two detailed messages.
- All functional logic (API calls, state management) is already in place on the frontend; the task is to wrap this logic in a new, professional UI.
- Use the new color palette and background color specified by the user. The primary reference for quality is Trendyol/Shopify Satıcı Paneli.
